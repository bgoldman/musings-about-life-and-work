Day One After (Part Two)

We're gathered in Dan's favorite place in the house --- our kitchen. The hospice chaplain has arrived. Kevin, my boys, and the hospice nurse are present too.

The hospice nurse is talking with my daughter and periodically passing the phone back to me to answer her questions.

Do we ask the transportation company to wait until my daughter and son in Asheville can get here and see their dad one last time? Or do we call them now? This is only one of dozens of questions to be answered. Then there all of the forms: The vital statistics form (for his death certificate), a donation form (authorizing tissue and organ collection for research), and a cremation authorization form. Something tells me that this is just the beginning!

The transportation company has been called. Now we wait for them to arrive.
