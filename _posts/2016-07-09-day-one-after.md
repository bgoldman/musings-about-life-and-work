Day One After

So Dan died yesterday. It was a very long day. 

First I had to call the hospice company to send a nurse to confirm that he was dead. Then we waited . . . all the while I'm talking to my youngest son to reassure him that nothing we did during our repositioning his father on the hospital contributed to Dan's death.

He doesn't believe me. I can see it in his eyes. He's terrified that we're responsible, but we aren't. I know it.

When the hospice nurse arrived, I met her at the front door and asked that she speak with my son. My hope is that he'll believe her if he can't believe me.
