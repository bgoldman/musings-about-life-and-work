Day One After

So Dan died yesterday. It was a very long day. 

First I had to call the hospice company to send a nurse to confirm that he was dead. Then we waited . . . all the while I'm talking to my youngest son to reassure him that nothing we did during our repositioning his father on the hospital contributed to Dan's death.

He doesn't believe me. I can see it in his eyes. He's terrified that we're responsible, but we aren't. I know it.
