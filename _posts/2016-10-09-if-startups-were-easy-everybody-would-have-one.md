# **If Startups Were Easy, Everybody Would Have One**

A colleague said this to me years ago. I was in my office on Mother's Day making the final changes to a marketing plan that was due for presentation the following day. I felt enormous anger over being at work when I really wanted to be home with my children.

But, did I truly want to be at home? At the time, I believed that I did.

---

However, I wasn't there. I was at work. My being at work on Mother's Day was a choice. It was a decision that I made. I could have chosen to stay home and try to reschedule the presentation. I didn't.

My lesson that weekend taught me a lot about the path upon which I'd embarked. Sure, entrepreneurship demands sacrifices --- from the entrepreneur, her family, his friends, and her colleagues. The entrepreneur's path is rocky, and very often lonely, yet the rewards in opportunity and growth can be amazing. I learned to be more conscious about my choices and more diligent about my priorities.

The following year I was at home with my children on Mother's Day and my startup didn't suffer.
