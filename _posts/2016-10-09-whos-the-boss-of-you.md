# Who's the Boss of You?

A number of years ago my eight year old daughter asked me, "Who's the boss of you, Mommy?"

After a few minutes of chuckling, I told her that I had many, many bosses and listed them for her --- my business's clients, the company's board of directors, and my fellow managers.

"But Mommy, I thought you had your own business," she said.

"I'm one of the principal shareholders, but that doesn't mean that I don't have bosses." I told her. Then I added, "If anything I have more bosses than if I worked for someone else."

"That's sounds terrible!"

I laughed at the seriousness in her voice. My young daughter had a good point. Sometimes having lots of clients, all of whom believe that they are your first priority, is demanding. However, my focus was normally on the variety of my days, which I enjoyed tremendously. I also loved that my work could be scheduled when I wanted to do it. While I wasn't particularly skilled at saying "No" and setting boundaries at first (see [08 October post][0]), I learned to schedule my work around my family, instead of vice versa. In reality, I became the boss of me as I learned to take care of myself and my family first.

So, I responded by saying, "Yes, sometimes having a business can be difficult, but _all work_ has a downside. There are advantages, too... I get to learn and grow everyday. For me, that outweighs all of the bad parts!" Then I added, "I love what I do!"

What about you? Who's the boss of you?
