### **What is a business coach?**

Business coaching is a type of learning and development for business leaders. A business coach provides insightful support, feedback, and advice to an individual or group to enhance personal effectiveness in a business setting.

Coaches help their clients move toward specific professional goals. These may include career transition, interpersonal and professional communication, performance management, organizational effectiveness, managing career and personal changes, developing executive presence, enhancing strategic thinking, dealing effectively with conflict, and building an effective team within an organization. Research studies suggest that executive coaching has a positive impact on workplace performance.

### **Who uses a business coach?**

A business coach may work with a variety of people who want to improve their work lives or are in transition, including small business owners, entrepreneurs, freelancers, or corporate managers.

### **What is a business coach vs. a mentor or sponsor?**

A mentor or sponsor relationship is typically between two people, one who is more experienced (mentor/sponsor) than the other, that work in similar professions or the same workplace. A mentor or sponsor helps the mentee with developing general skills toward an overall career path.

A business coach is a third party professional hired by an individual, sometimes by an organization on behalf of an individual or team, to work on specific performance issues, goals, or career or personal changes.

### **Why hire a coach?**

Typically a coach works with individuals or teams to improve their performance or productivity. Let's say that you're facing: 

* An urgent challenge or decision on the horizon
* A gap in knowledge, skills, confidence or resources that you're unclear about how to address
* A desire to accelerate your results
* A lack of clarity regarding choices that are available how to prioritize them
* A challenge with success
* Lack of balance between work and life, creating unwanted consequences
* Core strengths need to be identified, along with how best to leverage them

A coach helps identify parameters of the specific challenge you (or your team) want to address and designs a framework, which could include assessments, various exercises (individual and/or group), action plan development, or feedback and consultation.

### **What are the benefits of coaching?**

Benefits of coaching may include:

* Creating and implementing a business model that is sustainable and supportive of the team's energy
* Developing a better understanding of your (or your team's) strengths and challenges
* Improving communication, based on knowing various styles and needs
* Making decisions that align with your energy, rather than work against it
* Increasing trust and improving compassion
* Learning to show up confidently 
* Creating closer alignment with your values
* Having a safe space to process and plan various aspects of your business

### **What does coaching cost?**

Typical coaching fees are $125 to $250 an hour. In addition, individuals and teams can opt for customized monthly or quarterly packages.
