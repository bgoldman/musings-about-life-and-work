# There Are No Bad Teams, Only Bad Leaders

Why is [this statement][0] so hard for managers to hear and embrace? The first time I heard it was in my twenties. I thought at the time, "No way is this true!" I'm not responsible for John's constant disruption or for Jean's moronic behavior.

That's on them, not me! Right?

Wrong!

As manager of the team it was _all_ on me. I needed to learn to be a better leader and guide them toward functioning as valuable team members and leaders. It was a tall order for a 24 year old fresh out of college, but I accepted the challenge. As a result, their behavior changed, the team's performance improved, and I learned some important lessons about leadership, responsibility, and myself.

I'll continue learning what it means to be an awesome leader that people want to follow because if I have a bad team, it's on me.

How effective is your team?
