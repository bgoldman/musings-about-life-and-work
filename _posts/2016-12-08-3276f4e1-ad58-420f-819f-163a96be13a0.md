# Comfort to Discomfort to Joy

Imagine that today you're mentally jumping up and down with excitement. You're thrilled beyond description!

Why?

You can now perform that newly acquired skill with your eyes closed. Or maybe your joyfulness is because you're finally getting along with that difficult co-worker. Sure, he makes annoying comments still, but you're no longer bothered by them and you go about your day with peace.

Never mind that months ago you were struggling mightily to handle the new skill or co-worker. You were miserable, unhappy, and uncomfortable! In fact, you were out of your comfort zone!

None of us willingly moves out of a comfort zone. If we did, human beings would be quite different. Usually it's an event or person or (even) a sudden insight in our reality that pushes us to that place of discomfort and growth.

We define our future by how we respond (or not) to the opportunities for growth presented to us. Quite frankly when an opportunity does appear, most of us initially reject it.

How many times have you heard someone say, "This is too hard," or "I can't believe this is happening," or "I don't know if I can...\[get along with this person/handle this situation/solve this problem\]"? Every time someone utters any of these statements or something like them, s/he has been presented with an opportunity move out of a comfort zone and into growth.

Growth is satisfying upon mastery. When you discover that you're finally proficient at the musical passage you've been practicing for weeks, you rejoice. All of the practice that you endured day after day, week after week, has paid off and you can do it. Perhaps an unfamiliar skill becomes easy because you now fully understand that insight you had weeks ago. Maybe you've achieved a measure of peace about a previous event that "rocked your world."

Whatever it was --- person, event, insight, or other --- that initially pushed you into discomfort and growth is now behind you. It's done. Huzzah!!!

Still, there is the "between time" --- that interval of time bounded by the initial occurrence that began your journey of growth and your completion of the lesson. Personally, I think of the "between time" as the "it sucks to me" time. How do you travel through that interval? This is the challenging part because if you've moved out of your comfort, you are UNCOMFORTABLE! This isn't a fun time and it isn't meant to be. For growth, however, you must step forward and keep walking.

How can you keep walking? Here are a few techniques that can keep you on track during the "between time."

* Talk with a friend. Tell your friend about your growth opportunity and what you like and, more importantly, what you don't like about it. If you don't want to talk with a friend about your journey, find a counselor.
* Make time to focus on you. Start a journal to keep track of your journey. Take daily walks without any electronic devices so that you can use the time for contemplation. Indulge in a favorite activity on a regular basis.
* Be kind to yourself. Recognize that your journey maybe difficult or painful or sad --- possibly all three --- at various times. Let yourself feel all of the emotions that emerge during your journey.
* Know that you may want to give up. Usually this happens right before your mastery of the lesson and it's perfectly understandable. The important thing to remember is that giving up means no growth. Prepare for that possibility now! Whether you reach out to a friend or counselor, write yourself an affirmation, or something else --- _now_ is the time to find that one activity, thought, person that help you keep going.

Opportunities for discomfort (growth) happen continually throughout our lives. It's a never ending journey from comfort to discomfort to rejoicing and back. While it's certainly true that you may opt out, what is the sense of choosing a future filled with stagnation?

As a final note, I've listed techniques for getting through the "between time." I'd be interested in hearing from you about your techniques for getting through your "between times."
