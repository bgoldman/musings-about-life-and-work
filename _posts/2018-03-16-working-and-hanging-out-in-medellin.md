# Working and Hanging Out in Medellín

When was the last time you walked into a coffee house or shop and before you ordered the barista told you her name and asked for yours?

If your experiences are similar to mine, the answer is NEVER!

Imagine my surprise to encounter New Hearts Café in the Laureles district in Medellín. When you walk in, you discover a very modern, airy space that has both indoor and outdoor seating. Plus they have a rack of books from which you can select and enjoy reading while you're sipping on a juice, coffee, or tea.

Yet, there is more to this place. It's true that finding a place with great coffee and drinks along with plentiful electrical outlets can be a godsend no matter where you roam. New Hearts Café is special beyond that. 

As I entered I looked to my left and saw a poster. Yes, lots of coffee houses have inspirational posters. This one said, "A small positive change can change your
whole day or your whole life." Pretty inspirational, right?

The difference here is that they live this statement every day.

I ordered my limonada natural, which has become my new favorite beverage since being in Colombia. The staff pointed me to a table and told me that one of them would bring my juice when it was ready.

I sat and waited. I took out my computer, plugged it in, and began to work. After a several minutes my juice arrived. 

An hour later a friend from the coworking space arrived and we ordered coffee.

I spent three of the most pleasant hours ever in New Hearts this afternoon. Although it wasn't until I went pay for my juice and the coffees that I began to understand how remarkable this coffee house truly is.

I went to the counter to pay for our drinks and a young man approached me saying, "Pardon me, I know my English is poor, but I tell you about our coffee house." He went on to explain in really decent English that New Hearts Café is a social project developed by two entrepreneurs who love coffee and wanted to do something meaningful for children at risk, i.e. homeless or without useful skills for work or caught up in the sex trade business or any number of horrible things that can (and sometimes do) happen. 

Here's how it works. The rent for the space, the equipment, the furniture, and the supplies are all paid for by the two nameless entrepreneurs. None of the drinks have set prices. Further whatever I decide to pay for the drinks goes 100% to the foundation organized for the at-risk children in Medellín.

How cool is that?

Needless to say, I paid well for my drinks, defnitely more than I would have been charged at any other coffee house in Laureles. I was happy to do it because not only was I enjoying juice and coffee, but in my small way I was contributing to a small change that could make a difference in someone else's
life.

If you find yourself in Medellín, go to New Hearts Café. You'll get awesome service, a great drink, and best of all, you'll help make a difference in a young person's life.
