# Happy Thanksgiving 2018!!!

As I sit at my desk in Medellín it's simply another work day here. Yet, I find myself thinking about all the people, events, and activities that I have been privileged to know and experience.

I stepped out of my comfort zone in January and started a new adventure with the encouragement of my children, my friends, and colleagues. Would I have ventured out to South America without their support? Maybe. More to the point, it wasn't necessary or 
even a question! All of them cheered me on!

In the months since, I've encountered truly amazing and generous people in every country I've visited. They've welcomed me into their homes and treated me with such graciousness that at times I've been breathless with gratitude.

Tonight I'll join friends after work and we'll share a meal together in celebration of my favorite holiday. However, know this . . . I'll be thinking of each and every one of you tonight. I wouldn't be the person I am today without your help! 

Thank you!
