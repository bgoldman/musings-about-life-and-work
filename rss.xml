            <title><![CDATA[Coworking Spaces In Lima]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/3fae0a80-fb6b-40f3-9459-98d0b7b6dfe6.jpg">,<h1>Coworking Spaces In Lima</h1>,<p>I arrived in Lima late in the day. By the time I reached my rented apartment, it was after 10 pm. Still I was happy, excited, and ready for a new experience.</p>,<p>The next morning I started my rounds of coworking spaces. Little guessing what surprises were in store for me. Over the next couple of days I probably visited four different places. What I noticed first was how formal these coworking places were.&nbsp;</p>,<p>When I was able to visit inside a space, no one, apart from the manager/owner, spoke to me. Located in guarded office buildings, they had definite hours, no deviation. Another difference I observed was that I had to accommodate their schedule. If a space wasn't ready to give me a tour, tough. I could return later or move on. Most often I chose to move on. Finally they were really expensive, as in seriously more expensive than U.S. spaces expensive.</p>,<p>By my third day of searching I was very frustrated and venting that frustration in one of the digital nomad groups where I'm a member. Happily, one of the other members suggested that I look at one more coworking space before I consigned myself to a life of coffee houses and daily mobility. He sent me to <a href="http://partage.pe/" title="">Partage Coworking</a>.</p>,<p>I found a comfortable work home! The owner, Enrique, immediately showed me around the space. It was airy and light. The other people working there actually greeted me and were friendly. Enrique was nice also. He suggested that I try the space out for a day and make a decision after that. Once I met everyone and with the warm welcome, my decision was easy. I had found a place to work in Lima and it wasn't the Starbucks on Avenida Jose Pardo!</p>]]></description>
